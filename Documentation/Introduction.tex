\section{Introduction}
As deep learning is becoming an increasingly big influence in everyday applications, more and more focus is put into increasing its distribution to different platforms.\\
During the winter semester 2016/2017 a project seminar emerged, that laid focus on developing a mobile phone application for Google's Android operating system, that is capable of recognizing famous sights in big cities, like Berlin, from images taken with a smartphone camera.\\
Modern smartphones can, in some cases, outperform mid-range notebooks from a couple of years ago and, most interestingly, often have a dedicated GPU\footnote{Graphics Processing Unit}. GPUs are usually used for deep learning because of their high parallelization capabilities.\\
Part of this seminar was the evaluation of a fairly recent deep learning framework called CNNDroid \cite{cnndroid2016}, which uses GPU acceleration for classification and promises substantial performance improvements compared to CPU classification.
