\section{Google Streetview Crawler}
Classification of real-world images requires a very big dataset for the learning process beforehand. Google Streetview provides 360 degree images from many places in all German urban areas. Using sophisticated crawling techniques, a huge amount of image data can be extracted from these, so called, `Photospheres'.\\
This chapter describes how we used the Google Streetview and other Image APIs to crawl images from famous sights in Berlin.

\subsection{Image Crawling Script}

\subsection{Setup of viewing parameters}
Explain csv file

\subsection{State of Automation (i.e. taking one image per viewing angle)}

\subsection{Current Limitations}
Full automation not possible as of current street view API state; wrong latitude/longitude; Streetview Image API returns different images than JavaScript API (which is being used on google maps website)

\subsection{Possible Improvements}
Use Classifier to identify things in photsphere
