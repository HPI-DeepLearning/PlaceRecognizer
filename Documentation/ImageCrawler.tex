\section{Google Streetview Crawler}
% Don't know yet if I need subsections for these
\subsection{Setup of viewing parameters}
Explain csv file

\subsection{State of Automation (i.e. taking one image per viewing angle)}

\subsection{Current Limitations}
Full automation not possible as of current street view API state; wrong latitude/longitude; Streetview Image API returns different images than JavaScript API (which is being used on google maps website)

\subsection{Possible Improvements}
Use Classifier to identify things in photsphere
