We have several ideas to improve our application.\\

Second, we can improve the design of the app. Android studio come with some pre-code views that can be first use.\\

Compute real time recognition.\\

Then, as it is a application dedicated to recognize famous places around the world, a good idea is to be able to handle multiple languages for the wikipedia parser. In the project structure, multiple languages can be handled by using resource files with translations.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML, basicstyle=\scriptsize]
    #/values/strings.xml:
    <resources>
        <string name="hello_world">Hello World!</string>
    </resources>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML, basicstyle=\scriptsize]
    #/values-es/strings.xml
    <resources>
        <string name="hello_world">iHola Mundo!</string>
    </resources>
\end{lstlisting}

Also for the Wikipedia parser, we can get the phone language with a simple line of code
\begin{lstlisting}
    Locale.getDefault().getDisplayLanguage();
\end{lstlisting}
